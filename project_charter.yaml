  task: "Multimodal Entity Alignment with Cross-domain Transfer"

research:
  rq:
    - "What causes transfer degradation across language/graph domains?"
    - "Can domain adaptation + source selection reduce negative transfer?"
    - "How robust is the method under modality missing/noise?"
  hypotheses:
    - id: H1
      text: "Domain alignment loss improves target-domain Hits@1 and MRR."
    - id: H2
      text: "Multi-source transfer is more stable than single-source transfer."
    - id: H3
      text: "Missing-aware fusion degrades less at high missing rates."
